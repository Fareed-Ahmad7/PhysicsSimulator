# PhysicsSimulator
A fun physics simulator made with python, pygame, pymunk

Read this instructions before you try out the project:
1. install pygame and pymunk on your pc.
2. if importing pygame/pymunk gives error try running on venv.

// when the project is runned
1. To explore sections on main menu -> click on the buttons.
2. To return to the main menu -> click esc on keyboard
3. To store the values in motion of inclined plane -> click enter on keyboard after typing the input.
4. To increase gravity in collisions -> click up arrow on keyboard. (the more you click the more gravity increases)
5. To decrease gravity in collissions -> click the down arrow on keyboard. (Anti gravity is achieved when the value of gravity is less than zero)
6. To change gravity direction to right in collissions -> click the right arrow on keyboard.(the more you click the more direction turns to right)
7. To change gravity direction to left in collissions -> click the left arrow on keyboard.(the more you click the more direction turns to left)
8. To close pygame window simply use esc.
